# Why TypeScript

* To Provide Type system for JavaScript
* To Provide Planned Features from future JS editions to current JS engines

## The TypeScript Type System
* it increases the agility.
* it is easy to debug.
* it removes the unwanted things in JS

### Your JS is TS
* TypeScript is intentionally and strictly a superset of JavaScript with optional Type checking.
### Types can be Implicit
* it automatically assign type when it is initialized.
### Types can be Explicit
* Assing type explicitily
### Types are Structural
### Type errors do not prevent JavaScript emit
* TS only show errors at development time. but it emits JS.
### Types can be ambient
* so many lib are written in JS. to use JS lib in TS, it shows error.
* so we can fix it by assing "any" type

## Future JavaScript => Now
* it supports ES6, and other new features
